//1. Aim of the program - Define two packages as – General and Marketing. In General package define a class
// ‘employee’ with data members as empid(protected), ename(private) and a public method as earnings() which
//calculate total earnings as earnings basic + DA (80% of basic) + HRA (15% of basic)
//In Marketing package define a class ‘sales’ which is extending from ‘employee’ class and has a method
//tallowance() which calculates Travelling Allowance as 5% of total earning. Write the programs to find out
//total earning of a sales person for the given basic salary amount and print along with the emp id.
